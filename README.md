## How it Works?
- You can play this game by clicking any cell and typing any valid input until the game has been solved.
- If you want to see the solution, you can click the solve game button and the solution will be displayed by using the backtracking algorithm.
- To create a new game you can change the difficulty and a new game will be fetched, or once a game is concluded the **Solve Game!** button will be renamed to **New Game!** and clicking it will behave identically.
